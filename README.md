Absract: We know time is very important in the current time. By keeping it in mind we decided to design the following system.
As an identity card is necessary for every walk of life anything we start or anywhere we go we just need to bring it with us.
We do not have any web base project that can fetch data from the ID card and automatically store information in the database.
Admission to any college or university also firstly demands an identity card because all your data is stored according to it but clicking ID card Pictures and storing them in the gallery or collecting an ID card and then giving them back is such a busy and time taking process. Memory is also consumed in storing images too.
This Web-Based project will Fetch the information from the ID card by using a camera and store the information in the database in the form of an Original ID card. 
Every time we need identity information this system will automatically generate a form on the system screen similar to the Front and Back sides of an ID card a camera will be used for scanning and fetching information will be stored in it.
Applicants just need to scan the ID card system will fetch the applicant’s information and auto-fill in the required field.
This system saves the time of the applicant.
